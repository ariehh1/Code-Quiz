# Code-Quiz

This repository details a timed coding quiz focusing on JavaScript fundamentals. The quiz has a total of 10 questions and the timer starts when the user clicks the "start" button. There is a link to the highscores page to view all highscores submitted for the quiz.

When the user selects an incorrect answer choice, the timer decrements by 10 seconds.

When developing this repository, I thought back to the time when I was first admitted into the UW Coding Bootcamp.  I had to take an online assessment, similar to the one here, and test my pre-coding development skills.  I see this application playing a vital role in future job placement opportunities as employers want to assess their candidates' ability to think critically.
